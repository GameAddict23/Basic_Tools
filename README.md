# Basic_Tools Overview

This project is essentially just a way to provide basic but helpful tools for me and possibly other people as well. These tools may or may not be useful, but that's up for you to decide. I appreciate any critique, even if it is harsh.

*7/29/2020(M/D/Y) This is my first time creating and managing a repository as well as using Github, so just keep that in mind.

# Specifics

As of 7/29/2020, this project will provide tools to print 1D arrays to a console/terminal, filter desired characters out of a string, order an array of numbers from least to greatest and greatest to least, finding numbers in an array, and convert 1D arrays to other types of arrays (currently int, double, decimal, string, and char). The code itself has quite a bit of documentation as well, although I will go over the code here as well.

1. Basic_Tools.printArray(array)
    This method will take arrays of types int, double, float, decimal, char, and string and print them out to the console/terminal. 
    Examples:
        Basic_Tools.printArray(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6});
        Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
        
        char[] letters = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'};
        Basic_Tools.printArray(letters);
        Output: {a, b, c, d, e, f}
