# Basic_Tools Overview

This project is essentially just a way to provide basic but helpful tools for me and possibly other people as well. 

*7/29/2020(M/D/Y) This is my first time creating and managing a repository as well as using Github, so just keep that in mind.

# Specifics

As of 7/29/2020, this project will provide tools to print 1D arrays to a console/terminal, filter desired characters out of a string, order an array of numbers from least to greatest and greatest to least, finding numbers in an array, and convert 1D arrays to other types of arrays (currently int, double, decimal, string, and char).
